There are always rude people that are on discord. Some people just want to hop on there and make friends, but people make it unnessecarily hard for no reason 
by being mean. With our InclusiveBot, there is no more of this! InclusiveBot senses toxicity in messages and if the messages are a certain level of
toxic, InclusiveBot deletes the message and sets the toxic user straight.
